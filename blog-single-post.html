                  Partnership to Increase COVID19 Testing Capacity and Track All COVID-19 Variants
                </h1>
                <div class="post-desc">
                  <p>Driven by the principles of cooperation, coordination, collaboration and communication, the goal of
                    the continental strategy is to prevent severe illness and death from COVID-19 infection in African
                    Union Member States and minimize social disruption and the economic consequences of COVID-19. PACT
                    aims to strengthen capacity to test for COVID-19 across Africa, with emphasis on countries that have
                    only minimal capacity.</p>
                  <p> This will ensure that at least 10 million Africans, who would have not been tested, get tested in
                    the next six months. PACT will help meet the need of the Heads of State and Government for an
                    Africa-led and Africa-owned response.</p>

                  <p>“As businesses, we are nothing without a healthy and productive workforce. I cannot express in
                    words the gratitude many of us feel for the renewed mandate of Africa CDC from the African Union to
                    accelerate testing through the PACT initiative so that we can more effectively treat our compatriots
                    who have succumbed to this disease.” </p>
                  <p>PACT will be coordinated and led by Africa CDC, in close collaboration with the Africa Task Force
                    for Coronavirus (AFTCOR). Subsidiary initiatives shall cover the technology dimension, social
                    marketing and communications, knowledge sharing and dissemination, among others. AfroChampions, the
                    pan-African business leadership network, is a strategic partner for mobilising the continental
                    private sector in support of the subsidiary initiatives.</p>
                  <p>Africa CDC, with the mandate of the African Union Commission, shall embark on multi-stakeholder
                    partnerships to advance this and other subsidiary initiatives. </p>
